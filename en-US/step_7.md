On your webpage, you could improve the:

**Visual design**
+ The layout
+ Colours
+ Fonts
+ Emojis
+ Graphics
+ Borders
+ Gradients
+ Background images

**Accessibility**
+ Colour contrast
+ Font sizes
+ `alt` text on images

**Content**
+ The words you have used.
+ Would a list be more effective?
+ Should you use different heading elements?

**User experience**: Have you got the right balance of animation or visitor interaction without your landing page being overwhelming?

**Technical design**: Consider whether you could organise your CSS properties into classes that you would want to reuse. Make sure you have used sensible names for properties and added helpful comments to your HTML and CSS.
