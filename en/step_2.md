A landing page usually has a <span style="color: #0faeb0">**call to action**</span> which is something you want visitors to your page to do. This could be clicking on a link, trying out a hobby or activity, or sharing the page with others.

**Decide:** on the purpose of your page. What are you trying to convince your audience to do? It could be to buy something, take up a new hobby, to try an activity or to support a cause. 

Remember this purpose as you are designing your page. Try to make your page as appealing and persuasive as you can.
