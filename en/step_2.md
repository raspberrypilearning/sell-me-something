<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A landing page usually has a <span style="color: #0faeb0">**call to action**</span> which is something you want visitors to your page to do. You may want visitors to click on a link, try out a hobby or activity, or share the page with others.  
</p>

--- task ---

**Decide:** Think about the purpose of your page. What are you trying to convince your audience to do? The webpage's purpose could be to convince visitors to buy something, take up a new hobby, try an activity, or support a cause. 

Remember this purpose while you design your page. Try to make your page as appealing and persuasive as you can.
