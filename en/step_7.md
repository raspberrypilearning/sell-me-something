You could:
+ Improve the visual design of your page by adjusting the layout, colours, fonts, emoji, graphics, borders, gradients or background images. 
+ Improve the accessibility of your page by checking for colour contrast, font sizes and `alt` text on images.
+ Improve the user experience of your page: have you got just the right balance of animation or interaction without being overwhelming?
+ Improve the technical design of your page: consider whether you could organise your CSS properties into classes that you would want to reuse, make sure you have used sensible names for properties and added helpful comments to your HTML and CSS. 
+ Improve the content of your page: could you improve the words you have used, would a list be more effective, should you use different heading elements?
