You could improve:

**Visual design**:
+ the layout
+ colours
+ fonts
+ emoji
+ graphics
+ borders
+ gradients
background images

**Accessibility**:
+ colour contrast 
+ font sizes 
+ `alt` text on images

**Content** 
+ the words you have used
+ would a list be more effective
+ should you use different heading elements?

**User experience** - have you got just the right balance of animation or interaction without being overwhelming?

**Technical design** - consider whether you could organise your CSS properties into classes that you would want to reuse, make sure you have used sensible names for properties and added helpful comments to your HTML and CSS.
