## Add more style

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
A landing page needs to look really appealing. In this step, you can add additional styling to make your product or idea look really great.

You could add a **background image** to your webpage. This works well with transparency on your main content.

You could add a **gradient** to a `<main>`, a `<section>`, a `<div>`, or an `<img>` element:

**Tip:** Try to change the direction of the gradient to decide what you prefer.

**Tip:** Any changes that you make to classes in `style.css` apply everywhere on the webpage that the class is used. You may find that you want to introduce a new CSS class. You might want a third gradient style, different colour combinations, or different borders.

You can create a new class if you want more variety on your webpage.

**Tip:** You can change an emoji's size like you would change the size of your text. Use heading tags or `bigfont` and `hugefont` classes.
