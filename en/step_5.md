<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

You could add a **background image** to your page. This works well with transparency on your main content.

**Tip:** Try changing the direction of the gradient and see what you prefer.

**Tip:** Any changes that you make to classes in `style.css` will apply everywhere that the class is used. You may find that you want to introduce a new CSS class. You might want a third gradient style, different colour combinations or different borders.

You can create a new class if you want more variety on your page.

You can also change the size of elements using headings, or the style of text.

**Tip:** Emoji are text and you can change their size in the same way as text by using heading tags or `bigfont` and `hugefont` classes.
