You have this `dashed-border` class in your `style.css` file. 

--- code ---
---
language: CSS
filename: style.css
line_numbers: false
---

.dashed-border {
  border: 0.25rem dashed var(--detail2);
}

--- /code ---

You make a decision to use this dashed border style and a second dashed border style on the same webpage. 

Should you:

--- choices ---

- ( ) Change the `dashed-border` class to match the new style you want


  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. If you change the existing `dashed-border` class, then you will only be able to use one dashed border style on your webpage. 

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Create a new `dashed-border2` class with the properties for the second dashed border style. 


  --- feedback ---

  Correct. You want to use both styles in the same project so you will need to create a new class for the second dashed border style.
