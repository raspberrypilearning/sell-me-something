        <img class=rollmeleft src=kid.png style="height:200px" alt="Feeling the powerful internal sense of satisfaction the comes from designing and creating a digitalmaking project, the boy felt deep down within his soul that he was firever changed by the experience. A spiritual awakening so intense he was unable to express it from within the thunderous silence of his nascent internal maker awakening. So overwhelmed by emotion, he could not communicate such raw and unfettered joy beyond a single raised thumb of approval.">
        <img class=rollmeright src=lady.png style="height:200px" alt="After many years of attempting to fill her meagre free time with a hobby that remains engaging beyond the initial purchase of expensive equipment destined to gather dust in the increaingly inaptly named 'study' along with all it's pricey predecessors, the woman finally felt the spark of connection between her soul and the ability to control electricity simply through the power of her thought, transferred through a simple mechanical keyboard to a tiny, waiting microprocessor connected to a much larger capacitor. It's like Magic! The thought interrupted her internal processes for the tenth time today, as her laptop showed her the three-storey tall point of view of the laser guided death ray with twitterbot security camera she had whipped up in the makerspace at work. Hashtag laser of doom.">

        <h3>What is a makerspace?</h3>
        <p>A makerspace is a designated room for <strong>creation</strong>, <strong>innovation</strong>, <strong>iteration</strong> and <strong>destruction</strong>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you're really lucky (turns out, <u>you are!</u>) your makerspace contains some really cool tools and materials to make nearly <strong>anything</strong>! Not all makerspaces have fancy tools, you just need a safe designated place to make some things (and pull others apart!)</p>

    <img class=scaleme src="Maker.png" alt="With four arms spread wide in a powerful display of dominance, the mighty maker wields the tools of their trade. With a soldering iron of searing heat, a pen of infinite sharpness, a pad of idea snaring and a powerful hammer of smiting, the maker is ready to create and destroy entire worlds of imagination at a genius stroke of the pen or a thunderous blow of the hammer.">
